# Kwadzilla — The Biggest Lizard Breaks Out

A playable Shopify splash page. It's a *Rampage*-style arcade game: a giant
lizard comes ashore on an island built entirely out of prisons, climbs the
walls, pulls the buildings apart floor by floor, and gets everybody out.

Break a barred window and somebody walks free. The score that counts is the one
marked **FREED**.

Zero dependencies, zero network requests, one canvas. All art is drawn in code
(including the 5×7 bitmap font), all sound is synthesised with WebAudio, so
there are no images, fonts, or audio files to host.

## Files

```
assets/kwadzilla-game.js      the whole game (~87 KB unminified)
assets/kwadzilla-game.css     splash page + arcade cabinet styles
sections/kwadzilla-game.liquid   Shopify section, configurable in the theme editor
templates/page.kwadzilla.json    ready-made page template using that section
index.html                    standalone preview, uses the same two assets
```

## Installing on a Shopify theme

1. Copy `assets/kwadzilla-game.js` and `assets/kwadzilla-game.css` into your
   theme's `assets/` folder.
2. Copy `sections/kwadzilla-game.liquid` into `sections/`.
3. Either:
   - **Page template** — copy `templates/page.kwadzilla.json` into `templates/`,
     create a page in **Online Store → Pages**, and pick the **kwadzilla**
     template; or
   - **Any page** — in the theme editor, **Add section → Kwadzilla game**.

With the Shopify CLI:

```bash
shopify theme dev      # preview locally
shopify theme push     # publish to the store
```

### Section settings

Everything on the page is editable in the theme editor without touching code:
eyebrow, heading, subheading, intro copy, two CTA buttons, accent and background
colours, the footnote, and up to six "feature" blocks.

**Reward:** set a discount code and a score threshold. Clear the threshold and
the game-over screen reveals the code with a copy button; miss it and it shows
the target instead. Leave the code blank to turn the reward off entirely.

> Create the discount itself in **Discounts** first — the game only reveals a
> code, it doesn't create one.

**Sound:** off until the visitor interacts with the page (browser autoplay
rules), and the toggle is remembered in `localStorage`.

## Local preview

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard | Touch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move | `←` `→` / `A` `D` | D-pad |
| Climb up / down | `↑` `↓` / `W` `S` | D-pad |
| Smash | `Space` / `J` | SMASH |
| Jump | `Z` / `X` | JUMP |
| Rage | `Shift` / `K` | RAGE |
| Pause | `Esc` / `P` | ⏸ button |

Fill the RAGE meter by smashing. Cashing it in gives a few seconds of
invulnerability, and holding smash during it breathes fire.

## How the demolition works

Each facility is a grid of 8×8 destructible cells. A punch clears cells inside
a radius; when a floor drops below about a third of its structure it gives way
and everything above it settles down one row, so the building visibly sinks as
you gut it. Once ~60% of the structure is gone the rest can't hold itself up and
the whole thing comes down.

Cells flagged as lit windows hold someone. Destroying one releases them; they
drop to the street, cheer, and run for the shoreline. They're only counted once
they're clear of the island.

Buildings render into their own offscreen canvas and only re-render when
damaged, which is what keeps a few thousand cells at a steady 60 fps.

## Hooks for analytics

The mount element dispatches bubbling events:

```js
document.addEventListener('kwadzilla:gameover', function (e) {
  // e.detail => { score, freed, level, best }
});
// also: kwadzilla:start { level }, kwadzilla:levelclear { level, score, freed, bonus }
```

And exposes read-only state:

```js
document.querySelector('[data-kwadzilla]').__kwad.getState();
// { phase, score, best, lives, level, freed, standing, hp, x, mode }
```

## Accessibility and performance

- Real focusable buttons and links for every menu; the canvas is keyboard
  operable and only captures keys while focused, so it never eats page scroll.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` cuts screen shake, particle counts and the scanline
  overlay.
- Pauses itself when the tab is hidden or the game scrolls out of view
  (`IntersectionObserver`), so it isn't burning CPU further down a long page.
- Fixed 60 Hz timestep with a frame-time cap, independent of display refresh
  rate.
- 480×270 backing store scaled with `image-rendering: pixelated` — the canvas
  cost is the same on a phone as on a 5K display.

## A note on the setting

Kwadzilla is arcade fiction. Every facility, tower, sign and logo in the game
was invented for the game — no real place, company or person is depicted.
